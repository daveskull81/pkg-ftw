## Talk Notes

based on 5 Essential Ingredients for an Awesome Tech Talk by [David Neal](https://reverentgeek.com/5-essential-ingredients-for-an-awesome-tech-talk/)

## 1. Why did you choose this technology?
Problem that needed solving:
Needed to distrbute a simple command line app out to others.
These users aren't developers so running command line apps isn't something they have a lot of experience with. Needed to make it simple. Folks have experience with chat and can follow a prompt that walks them through the process. But, getting it installed on everyone's machine and teaching them to work through a command line would be too much.
I looked at Electron to make a simple app, but didn't need a complex UI. Using a command line interface that walks someone through two or three questions would be enough.

Made by Zeit who make other interesting / cool OSS projects like Hyper & Next.js
Simple to use. Not much change is needed to the existing project / workflow to get it working
Can make easily distributable executable (fun to say :) )



## 2. What does this technology do?
Describes it self as a "Single-Command Node.js Binary Complier."
Command line app that takes a Node. js project and packages it up to be run on its own. Node.js doesn't even need to be installed to use it.


## 3. How did you make it work?
1. What mistakes did you make?
2. Demo, if you must

## 4. Where to get started?
Project is on Github here: https://github.com/zeit/pkg
## 5. Wrap it up!
